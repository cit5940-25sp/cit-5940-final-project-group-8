# Small Programming Language Interpreter

This is a minimal interpreter for a custom programming language designed for the CIT 5940 final project.

## Features (To Be Implemented)
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- Control structures (`if`, `while`)
- Built-in functions (`print`, `abs`)

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Source code
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `examples/`: Sample programs
- `docs/`: Design documents and diagrams

| **Pattern**   | **How to Represent It in the Class Diagram**                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interpreter** | Create a `Node` interface or abstract class. All AST node classes (e.g., `NumberNode`, `BinaryOpNode`) implement it. |
| **Singleton**   | In the `Environment` class, add a comment like `// Singleton Pattern` and show a `getInstance()` static method. |
| **Factory**     | Include a `NodeFactory` class in the diagram. Show it is responsible for creating different `Node` subclass instances. |
